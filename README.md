1) In my weather test, I tested to make sure that the api recieved a valid city. Prompts to enter a valid US city if failed.

2) My bot also has a test for "!!", with that being a keyword it is activating the chatbot however I create a test case so that if the user is to activate the chatbot without a command that they will be notified that it's not a valid command.

3) To test the !! inspire bot is just checking to make sure it returns pulled data from twitter.

4) For socketio, I tested the connection of the socketio in my app.py file to validate that it is recieving a response.

5) I also created a test case to make sure that socketio is emitting correctly. 


In the future I would like to do multiple additional test to make sure that the database is recieveing the and emitting the correct data at any given time.
