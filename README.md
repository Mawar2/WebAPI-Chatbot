● What is the theme you’ll be using for project 2?
 The theme of my project is "Bright side"
 
● How did you incorporate your theme within your project?
   I incoporated the theme of my project by using the twitter api to render inspirational messages at the users request!
   
● What are at least 5 issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
 1) AWS locked me out of my project for a few days, which required me to do my project using visual studio code.
 2) Visual Studio does not allow for you to install heroku directly from terminal. Fix was to locate an extension that uses Nodejs to deploy heroku
 3) Had a challenge getting front-end messages to render. Fix was to collaborate with classmates and attend office hours.
 4) Had a problem with Google's authentication, server timed out due to using a "localhost" with a port. Fix is still underway but I believe it gets fixed by replacing localhost and ports with my heroku server address
 5) Chatbot is checking for "!!" keywords but is not displaying the chat message as anticipated. Possible Fix will be to emit directly from a chatbot class method.
